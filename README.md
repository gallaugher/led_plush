Scripts used when adding NeoPixel LEDs to a plush using CircuitPython

Scripts were written using an Adafruit Feather RP2040 & 20 LED NeoPixel Strand
The button_press_animations.py script also assumes a button is connected to pin D11

The simple script all_white_for_test_and_sewing.py just lights all lights in white at 50% brightness (which is all you'll need for this project, you probably can't see the difference between 50% & larger values). I use this script to test that I have LEDs wired properly, and keep this on when sewing in LEDs so I can see how the light shines through the fabric.
